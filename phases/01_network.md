## üó∫Ô∏è Phase 1  (Network Design) 
The company network consists of one main switch, one router, and a Windows Server for network services.  
All PCs and servers are connected to the switch, which uses VLANs to separate departments.  
The router provides communication between VLANs via subinterfaces.
