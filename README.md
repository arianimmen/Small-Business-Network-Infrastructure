# üè¢ Small Business Network Infrastructure (GNS3 + Windows Server)

## üìò Project Overview
This project simulates a small business network designed and implemented in **GNS3**.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in **network design**, **VLAN segmentation**, **inter-VLAN routing**, and **Windows Server administration**.

The simulated environment includes multiple VLANs for different departments, a central router performing inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick), and a Windows Server configured with Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP.

## üéØ Objectives
- Design a realistic small company network topology
- Implement VLAN segmentation on a Cisco switch
- Configure Router-on-a-Stick for inter-VLAN routing
- Set up Windows Server with:
  - **Active Directory Domain Services**
  - **DNS Server**
  - **DHCP Server**
- Test and verify network connectivity and domain integration
- Document and version-control the project using **GitHub**

## üó∫Ô∏è Phase 1  (Network Design) 
The company network consists of one main switch, one router, and a Windows Server for network services.  
All PCs and servers are connected to the switch, which uses VLANs to separate departments.  
The router provides communication between VLANs via subinterfaces.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Summary

### **Router (R1)**
- Router-on-a-Stick configuration  
- Subinterfaces for VLANs 10, 20, 30, and 99  
- Each subinterface assigned the default gateway for its VLAN  
- Connected via trunk link to the switch

### **Switch (SW1)**
- VLANs created: 10, 20, 30, 99  
- Access ports assigned to the correct VLAN  
- Trunk port (Gi1/0) connected to router for VLAN tagging  
- Management VLAN (99) used for switch administration
