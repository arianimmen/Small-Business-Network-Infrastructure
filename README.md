# üè¢ Small Business Network Infrastructure (GNS3 + Windows Server)

## üìò Project Overview
This project simulates a small business network designed and implemented in **GNS3**.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in **network design**, **VLAN segmentation**, **inter-VLAN routing**, and **Windows Server administration**.

The simulated environment includes multiple VLANs for different departments, a central router performing inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick), and a Windows Server configured with Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP.
